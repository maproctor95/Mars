# Mars
## Overview of Project

* Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
* Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.
 
### Purpose

I am utilizing Jupyter Notebook to scrape data and analyze data from a wedbsite in order to get more detailed information about what the pulled data shows.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

* During this assignment I was able to complete all the goals and objectives for the assignment. I used what I have learned in the class to trouble shoot the code as I went with Jupyter Notebook and made sure I was fully understanding what each part of my code did through labeling, so when an error popped up I knew how to approach the problem.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

* I think the biggest challenge for me was figured out how to do the data scraping from the website using the for loops. I hit a lot of errors and road blocks, but breaks and repetition won over and eventually I figured out what I needed to do.

## Results

* What are the conclusions you can draw about the data?
    * There are 12 months on Mars.
    * There are 1867 Martian days worth of data in the dataset, spreading from day 10 to day 1977. It is worth noting that in somedays data is taken multiple times. 
    * Months 2 and 3 are the coldest with an average temperature of -83.
    * Month 8 is the warmest on average with a temperature of -68.
    * In one Martial year, nearly 686 days pass on Earth
